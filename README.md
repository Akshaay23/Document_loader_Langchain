Learn Document Loaders in LangChain

This repository is dedicated to learning and exploring Document Loaders in LangChain, a powerful framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs). It includes practical examples, code snippets, and notes to understand how to ingest and preprocess various data sources such as PDFs, web pages, Notion, CSV files, and more using LangChain's document loading utilities.

##Topics Covered:
Overview of Document Loaders

Loading PDFs, Word Docs, and HTML files

Working with Notion, Google Docs, CSVs, etc.

Combining and transforming loaded documents

Best practices for data ingestion in RAG pipelines

This project is ideal for developers and learners who want to build intelligent applications using LangChain and need a solid understanding of how to get data into the pipeline effectively.
